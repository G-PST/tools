Capabilities\r\n\r\nPyPSA can calculate:\r\n\r\n* static power flow (using both the full non-linear network equations and\r\n  the linearised network equations)\r\n* linear optimal power flow (least-cost optimisation of power plant\r\n  and storage dispatch within network constraints, using the linear\r\n  network equations, over several snapshots)\r\n* security-constrained linear optimal power flow\r\n* total electricity/energy system least-cost investment optimisation\r\n  (using linear network equations, over several snapshots\r\n  simultaneously for optimisation of generation and storage dispatch\r\n  and investment in the capacities of generation, storage,\r\n  transmission and other infrastructure)\r\n\r\nIt has models for:\r\n\r\n* meshed multiply-connected AC and DC networks, with controllable\r\n  converters between AC and DC networks\r\n* standard types for lines and transformers following the implementation in pandapower\r\n* conventional dispatchable generators with unit commitment\r\n* generators with time-varying power availability, such as\r\n  wind and solar generators\r\n* storage units with efficiency losses\r\n* simple hydroelectricity with inflow and spillage\r\n* coupling with other energy carriers\r\n* basic components out of which more complicated assets can be built,\r\n  such as Combined Heat and Power (CHP) units, heat pumps, resistive\r\n  Power-to-Heat (P2H), Power-to-Gas (P2G), battery electric vehicles\r\n  (BEVs), Fischer-Tropsch, direct air capture (DAC), etc.; each of\r\n  these is demonstrated in the

SAM also has financial models for third-party ownership and community solar financial structures.\r\n\r\nSAM can model large or small projects, ranging from residential rooftop photovoltaic installations to large concentrating solar power generation projects and wind farms.\r\n\r\nThe SAM Software Development Kit (SDK) provides tools for integrating SAM into software projects developed in a variety of languages. It includes the Python package PySAM.\r\n\r\nSAM is an open source project, so its source code is available to the public. Researchers can study the code to understand the model algorithms, and software programmers can contribute their own models and enhancements to the project. Reference manuals describing the model algorithms are also available for download from the SAM website.\n\n### Mathematical Description\n\nSAM is a time series simulation model that uses many different component models to represent the different parts of a renewable energy system and to provide reasonable estimates of the power output of different kinds of renewable energy systems over a multi-year period. It runs hourly or subhourly simulations, depending on the temporal resolution of the weather data provided as input to the model.\r\n\r\nThe financial models are based on annual cash flow calculations.\n\n### Website\n\nhttps://sam.nrel.gov\n\n### Documentation\n\nDocumentation is available as part of the software and on the website at https://sam.nrel.gov\n\n### Source\n\nhttps://github.com/nrel/sam\n\n### Year\n\n2005\n\n### Institution\n\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory\n\n### Funding Source\n\nU.S. Department of Energy and other parnters\n\n### Publications\n\n> 100\n\n### Publication List\n\nPublications describing SAM's models are available on the SAM website:\r\n\r\nhttps://sam.nrel.gov\r\n\r\nGoogle Scholar lists many publications based on SAM analysis:\r\n\r\nhttps://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C38&q=system+advisor+model&btnG=\n\n### Use Cases\n\nSAM can model different types of renewable energy systems and financial structures for projects around the world.

It optimizes investment decisions for renewable and conventional generation, battery or hydrogen storage, hydro and other assets, based on how they would be used during a collection of sample days in many future years. The use of multiple investment periods and chronologically sequenced hours enables optimization and assessment of a long-term renewable transition based on a direct consideration of how these resources would be used hour-by-hour. The Switch platform is highly modular, allowing easy selection between prewritten components or addition of custom components as first-class elements in the model.\r\n\r\nWritten in Python, using Pyomo optimization framework. Models can be solved with any external solver (e.g., GLPK, COIN CBC, CPLEX or Gurobi).\r\n\r\n### Mathematical Description\r\n\r\nMinimize net present value of all capital recovery and operating costs over a multi-decade horizon. Core formulation is very simple — just requires balancing supply and demand in each region during each timestep. Then built-in or user-provided modules adjust the energy balance (adding elements to the supply or demand side) and the cost calculation (adding costs or netting out external benefits for some economic models). All components of the model are then optimized together. Modules can also introduce iterative behavior, e.g., an advanced demand response module uses Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition to optimize with non-linear demand systems and an experimental security-constrained unit commitment module uses AC power flow to iteratively update an internal DC representation.\r\n\r\n### Website\r\n\r\nhttps://switch-model.org\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\nhttps://switch-model.org/\r\n\r\n### Source\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/switch-model/switch\r\n\r\n### Year\r\n\r\n2008\r\n\r\n### Institution\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Funding Source\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Publications\r\n\r\n100?\r\n\r\n### Publication List\r\n\r\nPartial list:\r\n\"[Switch 2.0: A modern platform for planning high-renewable power systems](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.softx.2019.100251)\"\r\n\"[Switch: A Planning Tool for Power Systems with Large Shares of Intermittent Renewable Energy](https://doi.org/10.1021/es204645c)\"\r\n“[High-resolution modeling of the western North American power system demonstrates low-cost and low-carbon futures](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2012.01.031)”\r\n“[Cost and impact of weak medium term policies in the electricity system in Western North America](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tej.2021.106925)”\r\n“[The economic value of a centralized approach to distributed resource investment and operation](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.115071)”\r\n“[Biomass enables the transition to a carbon-negative power system across western North America](https://doi.org/10.1038/nclimate2488)”\r\n“[SunShot solar power reduces costs and uncertainty in future low-carbon electricity systems](https://doi.org/10.1021/es401898f)”\r\n“[Least-cost optimal expansion of the ERCOT grid](https://www.ideasmiths.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/APA_IS_ERCOT_grid_FINAL.pdf)”\r\n“[Deep carbon reductions in California require electrification and integration across economic sectors](https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/8/1/014038)”\r\n“[Variable pricing and the cost of renewable energy](https://www.nber.org/papers/w24712)”\r\n\"[Intercomparison between Switch 2.0 and GE MAPS models for simulation of high-renewable power systems in Hawaii](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13705-018-0184-x)\"\r\n\"[Making an Optimal Plan for 100% Renewable Power in Hawai‘i -

It aims at providing power system stakeholders with a transparent, flexible, interoperable and robust suite of simulation tools that could ease collaboration and cooperation in the power system community.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n**Dynaωo is an hybrid C++/Modelica open source suite of simulation tools for power systems. It aims at providing power system stakeholders with a transparent, flexible, interoperable and robust suite of simulation tools that could ease collaboration and cooperation in the power system community.**\r\n\r\nTo achieve this goal, Dynaωo is based on two mains principles: the use of a high-level modelling language Modelica and a strict separation between the modelling and the solving parts.\r\n\r\nDynaωo ‘s primary focus has been on long-term and short-term stability studies but the very encouraging results obtained and the flexibility of the approach led to an extension of the initiative. Dynaωo is now evolving towards a complete and coherent suite of simulation tools, sharing the same philosophy:\r\n\r\n  - **[DynaFlow](https://dynawo.github.io/about/dynaflow)** for steady-state calculations\r\n  - **[DySym](https://dynawo.github.io/about/dysym)** for short-circuit calculations\r\n  - **[DynaWaltz](https://dynawo.github.io/about/dynawaltz)** for long-term stability simulations\r\n  - **[DynaSwing](https://dynawo.github.io/about/dynaswing)** for short-term stability studies\r\n  - **[DynaWave](https://dynawo.github.io/about/dynawave)** for stability studies and system design with a high-penetration of power-electronics based components (quasi-EMT).\r\n\r\nMore information is available on the project website.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Mathematical Description\r\n\r\nDynaωo represents the power system behavior by a set of differential-algebraic equations (DAE). \r\nIt comprises  a  large  number  of  stiff,  non-linear,  sparse,differential  and  algebraic  equations,  augmented  by  discrete-time equations to define the evolution of the discrete variables\r\n\r\n### Website\r\n\r\nhttp://dynawo.org\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\nhttp://dynawo.org/docs/\r\n\r\n### Source\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dynawo/dynawo\r\n\r\n### Year\r\n\r\n2018\r\n\r\n### Institution\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Funding Source\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Publications\r\n\r\n10 - 20\r\n\r\n### Publication List\r\n\r\nThe complete list of publications using Dynaωo or related to concepts used in Dynaωo is available either on the website - http://dynawo.org/publications/ - or on the research gate project page - https://www.researchgate.net/project/Dynaoo-An-hybrid-C-Modelica-open-source-suite-of-simulation-tools. \r\n\r\nBelow are the most representative publications:\r\n1.

The current challenges of planning for grid expansion associated with the energy transition are answered by open_eGo.\n\n### Infrastructure Sector\n\n- [ ] Atmospheric dispersion\n- [ ] Agriculture\n- [ ] Biomass\n- [ ] Buildings\n- [ ] Communications\n- [ ] Cooling\n- [ ] Ecosystems\n- [X] Electric\n- [ ] District heating\n- [ ] Forestry\n- [ ] Health\n- [ ] Hydrogen\n- [ ] Individual heating\n- [ ] Land use\n- [ ] Liquid fuels\n- [ ] Natural Gas\n- [ ] Transportation\n- [ ] Water\n\n### Represented Behavior\n\n- [ ] Earth Systems\n- [ ] Employment\n- [ ] Built Infrastructure\n- [ ] Financial\n- [ ] Macro-economy\n- [ ] Micro-economy\n- [ ] Policy\n- [ ] Social\n\n### Modeling Paradigm\n\n- [ ] Analytics\n- [ ] Data\n- [ ] Discrete Simulation\n- [ ] Dynamic Simulation\n- [ ] Equilibrium\n- [ ] Engineering/Design\n- [X] Optimization\n- [ ] Visualization\n\n### Capabilities\n\n_No response_\n\n### Programming Language\n\n- [ ] C – ISO/IEC 9899\n- [ ] C++ (C plus plus) – ISO/IEC 14882\n- [ ] C# (C sharp) – ISO/IEC 23270\n- [ ] Delphi\n- [ ] GAMS (General Algebraic Modeling System)\n- [ ] Go\n- [ ] Haskell\n- [ ] Java\n- [ ] JavaScript(Scripting language)\n- [ ] Julia\n- [ ] Kotlin\n- [ ] LabVIEW\n- [ ] Lua\n- [ ] MATLAB\n- [ ] Modelica\n- [ ] Nim\n- [ ] Object Pascal\n- [ ] Octave\n- [ ] Pascal Script\n- [X] Python\n- [ ] R\n- [ ] Rust\n- [ ] Simulink\n- [ ] Swift (Apple programming language)\n- [ ] WebAssembly\n- [ ] Zig\n\n### Required Dependencies\n\n_No response_\n\n### What is the software tool's license?\n\nGNU Affero General Public License version 3 (AGPL-3.0)\n\n### Operating System Support\n\n- [ ] Windows\n- [ ] Mac OSX\n- [ ] Linux\n- [ ] iOS\n- [ ] Android\n\n### User Interface\n\n- [X] Programmatic\n- [X] Command line\n- [ ] Web based\n- [ ] Graphical user\n- [ ] Menu driven\n- [ ] Form based\n- [ ] Natural language\n\n### Parallel Computing Paradigm\n\n- [ ] Multi-threaded computing\n- [ ] Multi-core computing\n- [ ] Distributed computing\n- [ ] Cluster computing\n- [ ] Massively parallel computing\n- [ ] Grid computing\n- [ ] Reconfigurable computing with field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA)\n- [ ] General-purpose computing on graphics processing units\n- [ ] Application-specific integrated circuits\n- [ ] Vector processors\n\n### What is the highest temporal resolution supported by the tool?\n\nMinutes\n\n### What is the typical temporal resolution supported by the tool?\n\nHours\n\n### What is the largest temporal scope supported by the tool?\n\nYears\n\n### What is the typical temporal scope supported by the tool?\n\nHours\n\n### What is the highest spatial resolution supported by the tool?\n\nFacility\n\n### What is the typical spatial resolution supported by the tool?\n\nMunicipality\n\n### What is the largest spatial scope supported by the tool?\n\nCountry\n\n### What is the typical spatial scope supported by the tool?\n\nMunicipality\n\n### Input Data Format\n\nCSV\n\n### Input Data Description\n\n_No response_\n\n### Output Data Format\n\nCSV\n\n### Output Data Description\n\n_No response_\n\n### Contact Details\n\nludwig.huelk@rl-institut.de\n\n### Interface, Integration, and Linkage\n\n_No response_","issue_url":"https://github.com/G-PST/tools/issues/63","point_of_contact":null,"typical_temporal_resolution":"hours","highest_temporal_resolution":"minutes","typical_spatial_resolution":"municipality","highest_spatial_resolution":"facility","typical_temporal_scope":"hours","largest_temporal_scope":"years","typical_spatial_scope":"municipality","largest_spatial_scope":"country"},{"id":18,"number":65,"name":"Simplus Grid Tool","screenshots":["image"],"short_description":"Dynamic analysis and EMT simulation of power systems","focus_topic":"Stability, dynamics, state space, EMT simulation, GUI","description":"Simplus Grid Tool (SimplusGT in short) is an open-source tool for dynamic analysis and time-domain simulation of power systems (large-scale, multi-apparatus, generator-converter-composite, AC or DC or hybrid AC-DC).
