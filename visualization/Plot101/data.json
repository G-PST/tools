Spine Toolbox is modular and provides a skeleton where tools and models together with data can be combined in order to make a visual representation of the whole data processing chain.\r\nThe clear cut modularity of the tools and models within Spine Toolbox unleashes innovation potential, as it will be possible to develop new functionality without understanding the detailed implementation of all the parts in the application. This allows, for example, a large energy consumer to include a detailed model of their process within the larger energy system and seek to optimize its processes for cost-effective flexibility. Spine Toolbox can therefore be used to test new concepts and it can lead to new products, services and business models.\r\n- Website: http://www.spine-model.org/spine_toolbox.htm\r\n- License: Permissive (open-source, eg.
