Spine Toolbox is modular and provides a skeleton where tools and models together with data can be combined in order to make a visual representation of the whole data processing chain.\r\nThe clear cut modularity of the tools and models within Spine Toolbox unleashes innovation potential, as it will be possible to develop new functionality without understanding the detailed implementation of all the parts in the application. This allows, for example, a large energy consumer to include a detailed model of their process within the larger energy system and seek to optimize its processes for cost-effective flexibility. Spine Toolbox can therefore be used to test new concepts and it can lead to new products, services and business models.\r\n- Website: http://www.spine-model.org/spine_toolbox.htm\r\n- License: Permissive (open-source, eg.

The objective function is to minimize the lifecycle cost of energy services for a given location.  As a price-taker model, it is usually used to optimize technologies for a single \"site\" (a building or campus behind a single meter). The model leverages underlying performance models for different DER technologies, as well as programmatically assessible datasets such as the Utility Rate Database and NSRDB.\n\n### Mathematical Description\n\nMixed-integer linear program minimizing lifecycle cost of energy services\n\n### Website\n\nhttps://reopt.nrel.gov/\n\n### Documentation\n\nhttps://reopt.nrel.gov/tool/REopt%20Lite%20Web%20Tool%20User%20Manual.pdf\n\n### Source\n\nhttps://github.com/NREL/REopt_Lite_API/\n\n### Year\n\n2012\n\n### Institution\n\nNREL\n\n### Funding Source\n\nMultiple (DOE, DOD, industry)\n\n### Publications\n\n25\n\n### Publication List\n\n_No response_\n\n### Use Cases\n\n- Optimal sizing and operation of DER \r\n- Analysis of resilience provided by DER\n\n### Infrastructure Sector\n\n- [X] Electric\n- [X] Natural Gas\n- [X] Transportation\n- [X] Buildings\n- [ ] Communications\n- [ ] Water\n- [ ] Hydrogen\n- [ ] Liquid fuels\n- [ ] Biomass\n\n### Represented Behavior\n\n- [ ] Earth Systems\n- [ ] Built Infrastructure\n- [X] Financial\n- [ ] Social\n- [ ] Policy\n\n### Modeling Paradigm\n\n- [X] Optimization\n- [ ] Discrete Simulation\n- [ ] Dynamic Simulation\n- [ ] Analytics\n- [ ] Visualization\n- [ ] Data\n- [ ] Engineering/Design\n\n### Capabilities\n\n_No response_\n\n### Programming Language\n\n- [ ] C – ISO/IEC 9899\n- [ ] C++ (C plus plus) – ISO/IEC 14882\n- [ ] C# (C sharp) – ISO/IEC 23270\n- [ ] Delphi\n- [ ] GAMS (General Algebraic Modeling System)\n- [ ] Go\n- [ ] Haskell\n- [ ] Java\n- [ ] JavaScript(Scripting language)\n- [X] Julia\n- [ ] Kotlin\n- [ ] LabVIEW\n- [ ] Lua\n- [ ] MATLAB\n- [ ] Modelica\n- [ ] Nim\n- [ ] Object Pascal\n- [ ] Octave\n- [ ] Pascal Script\n- [X] Python\n- [ ] R\n- [ ] Rust\n- [ ] Simulink\n- [ ] Swift (Apple programming language)\n- [ ] WebAssembly\n- [ ] Zig\n\n### What is the software tool's license?\n\n3-clause BSD License (BSD-3-Clause)\n\n### Operating System Support\n\n- [X] Windows\n- [X] Mac OSX\n- [X] Linux\n- [ ] iOS\n- [ ] Android\n\n### Parallel Computing Paradigm\n\n- [X] Multi-threaded computing\n- [X] Multi-core computing\n- [ ] Distributed computing\n- [ ] Cluster computing\n- [ ] Massively parallel computing\n- [ ] Grid computing\n- [ ] Reconfigurable computing with field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA)\n- [ ] General-purpose computing on graphics processing units\n- [ ] Application-specific integrated circuits\n- [ ] Vector processors\n\n### What is the highest temporal resolution supported by the tool?\n\nMinutes\n\n### What is the typical temporal resolution supported by the tool?\n\nHours\n\n### What is the largest temporal scope supported by the tool?\n\nDecades\n\n### What is the typical temporal scope supported by the tool?\n\nYears\n\n### What is the highest spatial resolution supported by the tool?\n\nMunicipality\n\n### What is the typical spatial resolution supported by the tool?\n\nFacility\n\n### What is the largest spatial scope supported by the tool?\n\nMunicipality\n\n### What is the typical spatial scope supported by the tool?\n\nFacility\n\n### Input Data Format\n\nJSON\n\n### Output Data Format\n\nJSON\n\n### Contact Details\n\nreopt@nrel.gov\n\n### Interfaces\n\n_No response_",
